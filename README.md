# DART Listings NYC
Upcoming NYC events at the intersection of data, technology & art. 

# How its Made
This listings site is built off of a shared Google sheet. The sheet, published to the web, acts as the site's "backend." The upside of this is that Google manages the edit permissions and account details of those adding events. The downside (of this as implementated at least) is that dart.fyi itself is rather brittle -- the site will break if events namesh ave special characters at least -- but there is nothing to prevent someone from filling out event names as such in Google sheets.
